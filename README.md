# Grandma Chat Bot

The repository is the backend application that maintains our API endpoints to Grandma bot.
You can see it as a middleware between the Chatfuel and the collection of external APIs 
that we use to gather information.

It is hosted on Glitch with a monthly premium plan that enables unlimited user access and 
ensures the endpoints are always on.
